# Motif-data

Each dataset (**MOTIF 1** or **MOTIF 2**) has a folder containing .csv files. 
Each .csv file represents a route.
The name of the route has a format D-[number]-A-[driving behaviour].

For **MOTIF 1**, driving behaviour can be N (Normal), S (Semi-aggressive) or A (Aggressive).
For **MOTIF 2**, driving behaviour can be N (Normal), S (Semi-aggressive) or A (Aggressive).
